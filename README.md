# Prediction of Exchange Rate Values in Customs Duty Calculator

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for exchange rate values specifically tailored for use in a customs duty calculator. This will help in accurately calculating the cost of shipping goods to Indonesia. By predicting exchange rate fluctuations, businesses and logistics companies can better estimate their potential expenses, aiding in more effective financial planning and decision-making.

### Objective
Our main objective is to create a reliable model that forecasts the exchange rate values that are crucial in determining the customs duties for goods shipped to Indonesia. This model will help importers, exporters, and logistics companies mitigate risks associated with exchange rate volatility and plan their operations more effectively.
